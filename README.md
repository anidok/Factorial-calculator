# Factorial calculator

This is a program written on C to calculate factorial of a number.

## Factorial - What's new 
	Writing a factorial program is the most basic program in the initial learning stage of our programming
	life. But have we ever wondered that program is limited to calculate factorial of very few numbers
	as we can store values of order of 10^10 at maximum.	
		This program use efficient use of strings to store numeric values and extracting digits from the string
	to perform arithmetic operations. That's why it can calculate factorial of any number even if the result
	consists of a number that is several hundreds digits long.
